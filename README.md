This program was heavily inspired by the browser extension [scroll anywhere.](https://fastaddons.com/#scroll_anywhere)

## How to install

### Dependencies:
- ```x11``` to run your environment
- ```libxtst-dev``` to emulate scrolling
- (Optional) ```git``` to clone the repository

### Instructions: 
- Clone this repository with\
  ```git clone https://github.com/davidovski/anyscroll``` or by downloading and extracting the .zip file
- Enter into the directory with ```cd anyscroll```
- Type ```make``` to install

## How to use

A binary has now been created in your anyscroll directory. To run it, type ./anyscroll. If you want it to run on startup, add ./anyscroll to your startup.

And thats it! simply hold down you middle mouse button and move your mouse up or down to scroll.

Note: _there is currently a feature in many linux distros where the middle mouse button copies from your clipboard. This can be ignored in most websites or apps, but sometimes it can get pretty annoying. I am working to fix this issue, and if you have a solution, please contribute._

## Development

This project is still being actively developed and has many more features coming soon.
